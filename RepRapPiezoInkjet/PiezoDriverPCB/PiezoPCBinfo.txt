The PCB files here are not complete, nor has any part of this circuit been tested.

The circuit uses the TI DRV8662 piezo driver IC.
This chip accepts a 3-5V power supply, and can generate driving voltage up to 100V
It takes an input signal, and linearly amplifies it to generate the output signal.

For the testing I have been doing with my inkjet, I have used the Piezodrive Pdu100b,
which uses the DRV8662, as well as adding extra functionality such as DIP switches to 
set the gain (therefore setting the maximum output voltage. During my testing, I powered 
it from 5V, and the driving signal is a 5V square wave (genetated from an Arduino Mega). 
This caused the output to always saturate at 100V or 0V. Better results may be had by 
carefully controlling the wave shape.

I have also tested it a 90V, and the inkjet generally works just as well at this voltage.
At 60V and 70V, the inkjet does not work.



I believe the circuit in the Kicad schematic is correct, but it is untested. Component values
need to be selected.

The PCB has has components placed, but traces have not been routed.
