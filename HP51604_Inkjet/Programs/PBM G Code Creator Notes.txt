This is a very crude program to generate c code to print an image using the HP51604 ink cartridge
mounted on an ormerod

It takes a PBM (pixel bit map) image as an input. Note that there is no scaling applied. 12 pixels = 3.2mm
The image height should be a multiple of 12 pixels. GIMP can generate PBM images. Make sure the encoding
is ASCII.

The program must be recompiled if a different file required.

The .pbm image file must be in the same directory as the program. 

It would be better if it accepted user input to select its file, but I haven't done that.
